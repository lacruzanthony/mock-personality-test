## Showcase:
The idea is to create this behavior from [Psychologies](https://www.psychologies.co.uk/test/are-you-an-introvert-or-an-extrovert/?answers=#test) where we have some questions about personality.

We select the answer and the `Next question >` button is activated, we click it and answer the next question. If we want to change the previous answer we might click the `< Previous question`.

In the end, we could see our type of personality (which is a random choice) and retake the test.
